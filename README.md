Tell us about your current financial situation. Why do you need assistance?  

As a current student with no independent source of income, I rely solely on my father to cover my college tuition fees, pocket money, and other monthly expenses. My father has already taken out an education loan to finance my undergraduate studies. Given these financial constraints, it would be exceedingly challenging for me to acquire the necessary funds to purchase the certificate for this course. The provision of financial assistance would enable me to take this course without adversely affecting my monthly essential needs. I am in dire need of this financial aid, as I simply cannot afford to purchase the course for $49 in addition to my existing monthly expenses and college fees. I would be deeply grateful to receive financial support and a discount. If granted, this financial assistance would unlock a new world of edX courses for me, which would undoubtedly prove valuable in my future endeavors.
